title: Research Data Management for Humanities Researchers
---

This intensive four-day hands-on workshop is designed for humanities researchers who want to actively apply best practices in research data management in their own research projects. Recognizing the unique and diverse nature of humanities data—from digitized texts and images to audio recordings and cultural artifacts—the workshop provides practical, actionable strategies across the entire research data lifecycle, from initial planning to long-term preservation and reuse. 

This is a “bring your own data” workshop! Participants should arrive with the research materials they are seeking help in managing. This can be from an existing project or one you are just embarking on! (And we can point you in some directions if you’re looking for data!)

Participants will gain proficiency in developing comprehensive Data Management Plans (DMPs), essential for navigating funder requirements (e.g., SSHRC, NEH) and streamlining project workflows. Through practical exercises, the curriculum emphasizes effective organization and documentation of research materials, use of software for analysis and automation, and the critical role of metadata in ensuring data discoverability and long-term reusability. Sessions will cover secure storage solutions and long-term preservation techniques to safeguard valuable research materials.   

A significant focus is placed on the ethical dimensions inherent in many research areas in the humanities, addressing sensitive data, informed consent, use of AI, and the crucial principles of cultural sensitivity and Indigenous data sovereignty. The workshop also guides researchers through strategic data sharing by exploring appropriate repositories (disciplinary and generalist), applying robust curation practices, and navigating licensing and persistent identifiers to maximize research impact and compliance with evolving funder and publisher requirements. Upon completion, attendees will be empowered to confidently manage, preserve, and ethically share their research, enhancing the integrity, accessibility, and scholarly impact of their work.
